    "NumPy has a function called `multivariate_normal` that generates pairs of correlated datasets. The correlation values can be specified conveniently. A little bit of thinking is required, though. The function uses the covariance matrix. The covariance matrix is composed of 4 numbers. Two of the numbers describe the variances of the two datasamples we want to generate. The other two values describe the correlation between the samples and are generally called `covariances` (co-variations or co-relations)."
